- 👋 Hi, I’m Gal, and I use the nickname Caxixi. Caxixi is a percussion instrument used alongside the berimbau, another instrument, in a Capoeira roda. Indeed, Capoeira is one of my passions.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... many things. But healthcarre analysis is a major professional interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, SAS, SQL, statistics, and clinical data. Also: Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, and Yiddish. Also: Capoeira.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate, but would be happy to hear input and thoughts.
