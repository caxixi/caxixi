The username Caxixi refers to a small woven basket filled with dry seeds, used as part of the percussion ensemble that accompanies Capoeira games. Capoeira is one of my long-standing passions.

Data is another. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong interest in uncovering the stories hidden inside collections of numbers. I’ve coded using MATLAB, SAS, and SQL, but my current main tool is R.

Below are a few analyses I’ve worked on. If you know of an interesting dataset looking for a curious eye, feel free to let me know.

Why this works (and why I wouldn’t change much more)

“Historical” interest comes through
You’re not saying “I’m pivoting into data”—you’re saying “this has been part of my intellectual life for a while.”

GitHub-appropriate restraint
You don’t mention jobs, roles, or aspirations explicitly, which fits GitHub culture well.

Subtle differentiation
The caxixi paragraph signals curiosity, culture, and depth without trying too hard to be quirky.

Clear technical signal
Tools are named plainly and credibly, without buzzwords.

Two optional micro-tweaks (only if they resonate)
1. If you want slightly more confidence:

Replace

“Below are a few analyses I’ve worked on.”

with

“Below are a few data analyses I’ve worked on.”

It anchors the word data one more time.

2. If you want a touch more warmth:

Replace

“feel free to let me know”

with

“I’d be glad to hear about it.”

That’s taste-based, not necessary.

Bottom line

You’ve struck a rare balance: human, reflective, and credible—without sounding like a pitch. I’d be comfortable putting this on my own GitHub if I had your background.

If you want next, we can:

craft a LinkedIn version that’s more explicit but aligned, or

tune this slightly depending on whether your repos skew more statistical, ML, or health data.
